# JPMoganChase-Software-Engineering-Experience
Successfully completed the JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Software Engineering Virtual Experience on the Forage under the assistance of Jeremiah Bills and Eshrat Jahan
This opportunity had expanded a lot of my fundamental technical skills such as Python, React, Typescript, Git, etc. These are the following tasks I've completed within the experience:
1) Interfaced with a stock price data feed and analyzed it
2) Implemented the Perspective open-source code for data visualization
3) Used Perspective to design a chart for the trader's dashboard and worked on data visualization
